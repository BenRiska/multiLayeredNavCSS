# multiLayeredNavCSS
A fully responsive, multi-layered burger nav made with HTML/CSS and a sprinkle of javascript.


Hi + welcome to my burger nav! yay!

Made it because i was bored, learned some cool tricks about positioning the ::before and ::after pseudo elements to create shapes so it was worth my time :)

Feel free to use any components in your own work.
